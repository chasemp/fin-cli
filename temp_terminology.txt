## SAMM Maturity Level Terminology: Life360 Framework

### Life360's SAMM Maturity Terminology

Life360 has established consistent maturity level terminology that replaces both OWASP SAMM standard terms and previous SAMM360 web application terminology to create business-aligned, intuitive language for stakeholder communication.

**Complete Terminology Mapping:**

| **Life360 Standard** | **OWASP SAMM 2.0** | **Previous SAMM360** | **Business Meaning** |
|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| **Foundational (Level 1)** | Initial | Adhoc/Ad-hoc | Basic, structured practices |
| **Integrated (Level 2)** | Managed | Consistent | Security measured, consistent, embedded in workflows |
| **Enabling (Level 3)** | Defined | Optimized | Security accelerates, optimized & enabling the business |

### Detailed Maturity Level Definitions

#### **Foundational (Level 1)**
- **Core Concept**: Establish basic, structured security practices as prerequisite capabilities
- **Organizational State**: Security activities occur with basic structure and governance
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Basic security practices are defined and documented
  - Essential security controls are implemented
  - Security activities have clear ownership and accountability
  - Foundational governance frameworks are established
- **Business Value**: Creates security baseline and reduces immediate risk exposure
- **Progression Requirement**: Must achieve Foundational maturity before advancing to higher levels

#### **Integrated (Level 2)**  
- **Core Concept**: Security practices are systematically embedded into development workflows
- **Organizational State**: Security is measured, consistent, and integrated throughout the development lifecycle
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Security practices are repeatable and standardized across teams
  - Security metrics are consistently collected and analyzed
  - Security activities are embedded in standard development workflows
  - Cross-functional collaboration on security is systematic
- **Business Value**: Predictable security outcomes with reduced friction and improved developer experience
- **Progression Requirement**: Builds on Foundational capabilities with systematic process integration

#### **Enabling (Level 3)**
- **Core Concept**: Security becomes a business accelerator that optimizes and enables organizational objectives
- **Organizational State**: Security accelerates business goals through optimization and strategic enablement
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Security practices are continuously optimized based on business outcomes
  - Security enables faster, safer delivery of business value
  - Strategic alignment between security investments and business priorities
  - Security capabilities provide competitive advantage
- **Business Value**: Security as strategic differentiator that accelerates business growth and innovation
- **Progression Requirement**: Builds on Integrated maturity with strategic business alignment and optimization

### Implementation Principles

**Why This Terminology Framework:**
1. **Business-Aligned Language**: Terms that executives and stakeholders intuitively understand
2. **Positive Progression Narrative**: Each level represents advancement toward business enablement
3. **Clear Differentiation**: Distinct concepts that avoid confusion between levels
4. **Strategic Communication**: Positions security as enablement rather than overhead
5. **Cross-Repository Consistency**: Unified terminology across all Life360 security maturity materials

**Usage Standards:**
- Always use Life360 terminology in business communications and strategic documents
- Include OWASP SAMM mapping when referencing standard framework: "SAMM Foundational (Level 1)"
- Maintain consistency across SAMP documents, SAMM360 assessments, and organizational communications
