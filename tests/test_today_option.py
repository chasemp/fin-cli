"""
Test the --today option functionality across all commands.

This test file covers:
1. --today option availability in fine, fin list, fin list-tasks commands
2. Conflict validation between --today and --days
3. --today working with other filters (-s, -l, etc.)
4. Proper filtering logic for today's tasks
5. Integration with status and label filtering
